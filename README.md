# voice-controlled-command-system

This project involves the use of google assistant which aids us in the speech to text conversion which is linked to an applet created using IFTTT, the applet then links the google assistant to adafruit.io. We store all of our commands in adafruit under the feeds section. As soon as adafruit gets the information in the feed, it sends this information to the ESP8266 which is connected to a display. This information is then displayed. 
I have also added a custom made PCB which can be printed in the future.
